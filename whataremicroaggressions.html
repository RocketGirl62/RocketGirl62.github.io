        <h3>What are microaggressions?</h3>
        <p>Microaggressions are verbal or nonverbal insults that affect almost just people of color, with migrant background, who are a part of the LGBTQ community, who are in a lower part of the community, member of a religion with much less member than
            other religions or with mental or physical disability. Often the attacker doesn't even know that the things they say can hurt people. They think it's a compliment and if someone tells them that the things, they say are not ok and can hurt
            people they try to play it down or say that it was just a joke.
        </p>
        <p>There are three ways microaggressions can be shown:</p>
        <h4 id="microassults">Microassaults:</h4>
        <p>The attacker knows what they are doing and really want to attack the other person verbal or nonverbal to belittle or offend them. Microassaults resemble the typical racism. Probable that’s why microassaults are not important for the research to
            microaggressions.
        </p>
        <h4 id="microinsults">Microinsults:</h4>
        <p>
            Are insults that are about the origin or identity. They are subtle forms of reductions which the attacker doesn’t even have to know about but show their prejudice. The context is important for example if a nonwhite person gets compliments for their language,
            it also can mean that this is rare. Microinsults can be nonverbal too an example for this could be that a nonwhite person doesn't gets as much attention as a white person or gets ignored.
        </p>
        <h4 id="microinvalidations">Microinvalidations:</h4>
        <p>Are ways of expressions which ignores, exclude or belittle thoughts or feelings of other people.</p>
