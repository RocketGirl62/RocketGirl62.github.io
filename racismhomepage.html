        <h3>Racism</h3>
        <p>Racism is one of the biggest forms of discrimination nowadays. Many events in the recent past are making more people talk about it and raise awareness. So does this website. Just think about the “Black Lives Matter” movement. But there are even
            more things happening where we racism is an enormous topic.</p>
        <p>For living in peace, it´s necessary that there´s no racism and discrimination anymore but many people don´t really know that much about this topic. Therefore, people should talk more about it and our website should help them getting informed.</p>
        <p>So, let’s start:</p>
        <h3 id="whatisracism">What is racism?</h3>
        <p>Racism means the belief that humans can be divided in different races because of biology and origin and that some races are predominating others, leading to the discrimination of these groups. Most people when they hear about racism just think
            of the discrimination of people because of their origin or skin color, but there could also be discrimination because of people’s religion.</p>
        <p>The start of racism was because of the attempt to find an answer to the question why people from Africa are different to people from Europe. They were trying to find an explanation why white people are worth more than black people. In this time
            the scientist Charles Darwin discovered that there are different races of for example different types of birds. Some people have misinterpreted this, and racism was born.</p>
        <p>Of course, today its scientifically proven that there´s no such difference but it´s still in the mind of some people for being used for political reasons.</p>
