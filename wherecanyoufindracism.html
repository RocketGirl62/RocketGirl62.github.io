        <h3>Where can you find racism?</h3>
        <p>You can find racism everywhere. In every country, in politics, in social media, and other media. Really everywhere and yes, also in computers. But let’s talk about this very specific aspect later.</p>
        <p>First, you won’t find any country on the globe were nobody is a racist. Some people talk about the things they think louder, and clearer others stay silent. Mostly, you find racist comments when people discuss about refugees. But also, at the
            beginning of the corona pandemic one has heard many racist comments and seen different reactions to some people. The corona virus SARS-CoV 2 most probably origins from China and because of that, many people, for example in Germany, forewent
            people looking Asian. Just because they thought they could get infect by them. Still now there´s more racism in the pandemic than before but not anymore restricted to Asian people only. Now people think people with a migration background would
            infect everyone because they think everyone with such a background has a huge family and doesn’t follow the Corona rules. But that is wrong. You can’t think about everyone the same way and not even if they have a migration background. This
            is also racism.</p>
        <p>Computers can be racists too. The sometimes-discriminating part of a computer is an AI. AI means Artificial Intelligence, that means the computer can learn things without anyone programming everything. Therefore, you give the AI a set of data
            it can learn with and improve. For example, if you want to train the computer to look at a picture and say if there is a human. But if most of the data that was collected only shows white people as an example for the computers on how human
            look like, the AI might discriminate other people in the sense that he doesn’t consider them as human, which can be seen as a kind of racism. Most times the programmer didn`t think about this aspect and didn’t have the intention to program
            a racist AI program. Therefore, we need to raise awareness on racism and if you’ll program an AI you should carefully review the data sets being used for training the AI.</p>
