        <h3>Where can you find racism?</h3>
        <p>You can find racism everywhere. In every country, in the politics, in social media, in other medias etc. Really everywhere and yes, also in computers. But we´ll tell you later where a computer can be racist.</p>
        <p>First, you won’t find any country were nobody is racist. Some people tell the things they think louder, and clearer others don’t. Mostly you find racist comments when people discuss about refugees. But also, at the beginning of the corona pandemic
            you’ve heard many racist comments and see different reactions to some people. The corona virus SARS-CoV 2 comes from China and because of that, many people, for example in Germany, went around people looking Asian. Just because they thought
            they could infect him or her. But still now there´s more racism in the pandemic than before but not anymore about Asian people. Now people think people with a migratory background would infect everyone because they think everyone with such
            a background has a huge family and don’t follow the rules. But that’s wrong. You can’t think about everyone the same way and not even if they have a migratory background. This is also racist.</p>
        <p>too. The sometimes racist part of a computer is an AI. AI means Artificial Intelligence, that means the computer can learn stuff without anyone programming everything. Therefore, you give the AI a set of data it can learn with and get better.
            For example, if you want to train the computer to look at a picture and say if there is a human. But most of the data was collected by white people and only include white people as an example for a human. If that happens, the AI will get racist.
            It won’t say that black people are humans and only see white people as humans. Most times the programmer didn`t thought about that hasn’t had the intention to program a racist AI. Therefor we should raise more awareness and if you’ll program
            an AI you should have a look at your data first if it really includes everything.</p>
